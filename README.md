# NLPDemo

Our group from ASU, working alongside a real company, was tasked with finding matches between tenants and homeowners who shared similar likes and dislikes based on a survey they had to fill out. The best our group had come up with was simple string matching, so I set out to find and demonstrate a better method. All my research pointed me towards natural language processing.

This demo I created was used to show the sponsor at the company, as well as my group, how we could utilize natural language processing to reduce the amount of filler words in each survey response by a lot as well as reduce words into their most basic form enabling easier matching.
